# Appstore

## Description
The main goal of this project is to design and implement an sorting algorithm, so that all the app are ordered by its rating star as well as the times they are recommended by other apps. The whole project is based on the Meteorjs framework. We use HTML, css, Javascript to design the webpage, nodejs to implement the server, and Mongodb to serve as a database. Besides the required functions, we will ingrate more functions to make the web application more interesting and practical.


## Function
###Basic:

* Displays the apps in the web page
	* The app list
	* The app details 
* Sort the apps by its rating stars and the times they are recommended


###Addictional:

* Crawl the data source from official app store
* Dynamically get data from server
* Download apk files

## Plan

### Todo List

* Learn the framework of Meteorjs and anything related
* Design an algorithm to sort the apps by their rating stars and the times they are recommended
* Redesign the whole page
* Adapt the server to fulfill all the functions we are going to implement
* Make a contract about the format of data source
* Design and implement a crawler to crawl the real data from appstore
* Implement the function to download apk
